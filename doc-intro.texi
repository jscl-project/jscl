JSCL  is a  Common Lisp  implementation  designed to  operate under  the
JavaScript (ECMA-262) runtime environment in a web browser or Node.js.

At present,  it is fairly incomplete,  and this manual is  in pretty bad
shape, as well.

For a  good reference to the  Common Lisp ANSI specification,  Google up
a copy of the Common Lisp HyperSpec, such as that shared by LispWorks.

For details of  JSCL, this manual ---  and the source code  --- are your
best bet.
