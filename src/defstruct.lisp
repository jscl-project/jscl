;;; HACK HACK. Use SBCL structures during XC.
;;
;; There's an Issue on GitHub for this (TODO: Log it)

;; The  long and  the short  of it  is, the  type system  being compiled
;; relies  upon the  host  compiler's  type system,  and  the JSCL  type
;; system,  in  turn, relies  circularly  upon  DEFSTRUCT. So  there  is
;; a truly  nasty solution: we compile  with the host (let's  say, SBCL)
;; providing the structures,  then when we recompile,  things kinda fall
;; into place. This EVAL-WHEN thunk is the source of the evil magic that
;; makes this possible.
;;
;; The cross-compiler will emit  macroexpansions of JSCL:!/name/ because
;; this  branch does  not  yet  have a  JSCL/CL  package  set up  during
;; cross-compilation  phase  to  represent the  COMMON-LISP  package  at
;; run-time. (That branch rotted and isn't being maintained yet.) A side
;; effect of  that is that the  runtime package violates the  ANSI rules
;; about exporting extra symbols, but that's a future worry. In the mean
;; time, this  !DEFSTRUCT is a  redirector that takes advantage  of that
;; redirection. In  future, if this hack  is kept in play,  it should be
;; updated to  reflect JSCL/CL::DEFSTRUCT  and JSCL/INTERNALS::DEFSTRUCT
;; or something similar.
