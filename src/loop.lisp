;;;; LOOP Iteration Macro

;;; This is the "officially sanctioned" version of LOOP for running in
;;; Common Lisp.  It is a conversion of LOOP 829, which is fairly close to
;;; that released with Symbolics Release 6.1 (803).  This conversion was
;;; made by Glenn Burke (one of the original author/maintainers);  the
;;; work was performed at Palladian Software, in Cambridge MA, April 1986.
;;; 
;;; The current version of this file will be maintained at MIT, available
;;; for anonymous FTP on MC.LCS.MIT.EDU from the file "LSB1;CLLOOP >".  This
;;; location will no doubt change sometime in the future.
;;; 
;;; This file was actually taken from ai.mit.edu:pub/loop-macro.tar
;;;
;;; This file, like the LOOP it is derived from, has unrestricted
;;; distribution -- anyone may take it and use it.  But for the sake of
;;; consistency, bug reporting, compatibility, and users' sanity, PLEASE
;;; PLEASE PLEASE don't go overboard with fixes or changes.  Remember that
;;; this version is supposed to be compatible with the Maclisp/Zetalisp/NIL
;;; LOOP;  it is NOT intended to be "different" or "better" or "redesigned".
;;; Report bugs and propose fixes to BUG-LOOP@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU;
;;; announcements about LOOP will be made to the mailing list
;;; INFO-LOOP@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Mail concerning those lists (such as requests
;;; to be added) should be sent to the BUG-LOOP-REQUEST and
;;; INFO-LOOP-REQUEST lists respectively.  Note the Change History page
;;; below...
;;; 
;;; LOOP documentation is still probably available from the MIT Laboratory
;;; for Computer Science publications office:
;;; 	LCS Publications
;;; 	545 Technology Square
;;; 	Cambridge, MA 02139
;;; It is Technical Memo 169, "LOOP Iteration Macro", and is very old.  The
;;; most up-to-date documentation on this version of LOOP is that in the NIL
;;; Reference Manual (TR-311 from LCS Publications);  while you wouldn't
;;; want to get that (it costs nearly $15) just for LOOP documentation,
;;; those with access to a NIL manual might photocopy the chapter on LOOP.
;;; That revised documentation can be reissued as a revised technical memo
;;; if there is sufficient demand.
;;;

;;; The changes noted below are in the version maintained by mkant@cs.cmu.edu.
;;;
;;; Bob Bane [JRB] <bane%rattler@cs.UMD.EDU> 11/02/90
;;; Changes to bring loop.lisp in closer conformance with CLtL2:
;;;  Changed loop-optional-type to allow optional of-type keyword.
;;;  Changed LOOP-DO-COLLECT to accept
;;;    <collect-operator> <expr> [into <rvar>] [<type-spec>]
;;;    the old code accepted
;;;    <collect-operator> <expr> [<type-spec>] [into <rvar>]
;;;
;;; The following change in the version from rascal.ics.utexas.edu doesn't
;;; seem to be necessary anymore, so it isn't implemented here.
;;; <boyer@rascal.ics.utexas.edu> 7/9/87
;;; In define-loop-macro moved &environment and its formal to right after
;;; &whole to overcome bug in KCL. This replaces
;;; (&whole whole-form &rest keywords-and-forms &environment env) with
;;; (&whole whole-form &environment env &rest keywords-and-forms).
